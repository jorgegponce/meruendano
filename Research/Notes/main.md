# AI Research Brain

This is a growing document with my ideas for this project. It is already very ambitious, but I am excited by the prospect of making this happen. It could turn into a very very useful and helpful productivity tool. A tool that goes beyond notion or obsidian or software like that and allows you to interact with your notes/library in a much more meaningful way.

*ChatGPT's description:* ðŸ”® A self-evolving, multimodal research graph + agent that merges your own work with the world's literature, and becomes your scientific thought partner.

It is unclear to me, however, if I should just try to build this on top of already existing software (like notion or obsidian). I will say I think using obsidian or some other simple note taking software would be a good idea. 

What am I building? I envision this as an intelligent personal library for scientific research. It would be a place where you can store all your notes, papers, images, sketches, etc. (any sort of data which a researches might accumulate) and be able to explore it, parse it, and come up with new ideas, and the interface should be based off of natural language. 

I essentially want to use all of my personal research data to create an expert in the field (one that is able to access, parse, and understand all the data you've compiled) with which you are able to have stimulating conversations to come up with new ideas and advance in your research. I almost want this to be the perfect research collaborator hahahahhaha A collaborator which is able to understand your questions, help you make progress, and stimulate new novel ideas in your specific scientific direction, all backed by real and reliable sources (sources you provided and have control over)

Almost like an IDE but for scientific research

I think it should be able to accomplish the following tasks:

* Parse all your data in different formats, store it in an easily accesible way, and comprehend it. Actually understand what it says.
    - All your data should be parseable with natural language. 
        - Example: "Hey, I remember I once took notes about Laplace's method. Can you help me find them?" Or help you find citations within your own library to explain something: "Which sources can I use to back up this calculaion?," "Explain to me how the the calculation on this paper works based on my notes from physics 181".

    - It should also almost provide you with a way to index your notes. Come up with a system, almost like a library system, to index and oranize all your notes: Papers, pdfs, images, pictures, csv files, json files, videos, handwritten notes, etc. It should also allow you to access these index with natural language: "what is the index item for my physics 260 notes? specifically my notes on stabilizer codes" and it point out to where that file is, it's index name, and stuff like that

    - You should be able to interact with it.
        - Be able to explore and visualize your notes:
            - Show some sort of knowdledge graphs based on keywords. Find connections between your notes: Ask the AI brain to find connections between your papers based on specific keywords or phrases, and how these connect with each other. That way you should be able to explore your knowledge and also extract important concepts or see what the most important ideas shared accross the papers are
            
            - Be able to relibale explain your notes. Example: you have a graph showing the relationship between the detuning and the population transfer, and you have several notes and textbooks that explain this phenomenon, so when asked about it, this brain should point you to the right places in your notes to explain it. If it cannot find any reference, then it should be able to refer you to other resources (I am thinking we could use like perplexity AI for this sort of work)

            - It would also be nice it if allows you to digitize your information. Perhaps like to be able to easily turn tables into CSV files and stuff like that, and also allow you store that and analyze that data

* Help you with literature review. Given all your library, this should be able to understand any new ideas you might have, suggest whether your idea is correct or not based on your data, and also help you find references.
    - The model should be able to use your library to find more references. That is, it should be able to see all the citation in your papers, be able to access them, understand them, and see if they are helpful. And be able to repeat this process. It should be able to point you towards the right sources to further explore your ideas, and also give you feedback as to whether your ideas are possible or not.

            

## Questions?

How should I organize this? Is this a wiki?

Should I use already existing software like obsidian or notion? I kinda hate notion because it is a bit too complex for my liking. 

It seems like if we could use something like obsidian, that would be great. Or, if not, to use software to create a wiki. It would also be cool to use software like Zotero. Maybe Zotero is what I need?
